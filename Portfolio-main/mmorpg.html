					<h2>Video Game Database Analysis</h2>
					<p>SQL and Tableua for accessing, cleaning, and analyzing data.</p>
				</header>

				SQL code for this project can be found 
				<a href="https://github.com/BrandonWichern/Portfolio/blob/main/MMORPG/MMORPG-Data.sql">here</a>.

				<h3>Background</h3>
				<p>Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPGs) have extensive databases encompassing
					different aspects of the game.
					I was fortunate to find and form multiple different teams over the years to work on a game for
					learning and fun.
					The projects utilized Java and MySQL for development and storage.</p>

				What does this have to do with data analysis?<br>
				For this project, I decided to choose data that was exciting to me and unique.<br>
				One can only endure so many COVID data projects.<br>
				<br>
				The database I used is from an early version of the game.<br>
				I had never thought about how maintaining a video game database and getting feedback to make informed
				decisions involved a similar skill set to data analytics.<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Objectives</h3>
				<DL>
					<DD>1. Analyze the data set to determine avenues for gameplay balance and improvement.</DD>
					<DD>2. Determine which aspects of the data can be routinely surveyed to ensure proper operations.</DD>
				</DL>
				
				<h3>Preparation</h3>

				What do we have?

				<p>
					I connected to a local MySQL database that I had used for testing. My weapon of choice was Navicat,
					by PremiumSoft CyberTech - a SQL database management and development system.
					<br><br>
					Understanding the data is vital to the process.
					Data modeling is a way to organize and connect data for effective analysis.
					The pieces fit together like a puzzle to see the bigger picture.
					Models can help to make sense of the information in a system.
					This makes it easier to retrieve and filter out the data necessary for a business objective.
					<br><br>
					Data modeling can be used to document data requirements for applications prior to development or
					extract from an existing system to better understand the structure of existing relationships.
				</p>

				<h3>Explaining the Model</h3>

				Nice to know:
				I felt it was necessary to include a description of the data for better understanding.
				<br><br>
				Each player creates an account that hosts their characters.<br>
				Characters in the game can be 1 of 5 classes:
				<DL>
					<DD>Monarch</DD>
					<DD>Knight</DD>
					<DD>Wizard</DD>
					<DD>Elf</DD>
					<DD>Dark Elf</DD>
				</DL>

				Each character has 6 stats:
				<DL>
					<DD>(STR) Strength</DD>
					<DD>(CON) Constitution</DD>
					<DD>(DEX) Dexterity</DD>
					<DD>(CHA) Charisma</DD>
					<DD>(INT) Intelligence</DD>
					<DD>(WIS) Wisdom</DD>
				</DL>

				The items characters have are classified into 1 of 3 categories:

				<DL>
					<DD>armor (helmets, boots, gloves...)</DD>
					<DD>weapon (swords, bows, daggers...)</DD>
					<DD>other (etcitems - potions, arrows, currency...)</DD>
				</DL>

				The database has 77 tables.<br>
				I created a simplified data model of the relationship between 6 of them as a visual explanation.
				<br><br>
				<img src="images/mmorpg-model.jpg" width="633" height="590">
				<br><br>

				What can be done with this data?<br>
				I came up with a few questions to answer.
				<br><br>
				<h4>Gameplay Experience Improvement</h4>
				<dl>
					<dt>What types of characters do people have?</dt>
					<dd>Are there any underutilized classes that can be improved?</dd>
					<br>
					<dt>What stats do they have?</dt>
					<dd>Are any stats lacking in usefulness that can be improved?</dd>
					<br>
					<dt>What weapons are they using?</dt>
					<dd>Which areas need more diverse choices?</dd>
					<br>
					<dt>What enchant level are weapons?</dt>
					<dd>What do players consider worth spending extra money to improve?</dd>
					<dd>Is more variety necessary?</dd>
					<br>
				</dl>

				<h4>Routine Checks</h4>
				<dl>
					<dt>Do all bosses in the spawnlist exist in the monster list?</dt>
					<dd>Was a boss added that does not have corresponding monster data?</dd>
					<br>
					<dt>Do all items in shops exist in the items tables?</dt>
					<dd>Was an item added to shops that does not have corresponding item data?</dd>
					<br>
					<dt>How much money do characters have?</dt>
					<dd>Is there an excess of currency?</dd>
					<dd>Are there any extreme outliers that need explanation?</dd>
					<br>
				</dl>
				<h3>Digging In</h3>
				How can we get the information needed?<br>
				First, how many characters are availble for the analysis?<br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">View Code</button>
<div class="content">
<pre><code>
-- How many characters are there?
SELECT
	COUNT(*)
FROM
	characters
</code></pre>
</div>
				<br><br>
				Result: 401 characters<br>
				<br>
				Exploring the data reveals that some characters were recently made and administrator characters show in
				the results.
				Those can be filtered out with a WHERE clause.
				<br>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">View Code</button>
<div class="content">
<pre><code>
-- How many characters are there?
-- Exclude admin and low level characters
SELECT
	COUNT(*)
FROM
	characters
WHERE
	AccessLevel = 0 AND level > 10
</code></pre>
</div>
				<br><br>
				Result: 253 characters<br>
				<br>
				Saving this subset to a temporary table makes it readily available for the remaining queries.
				<br>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">View Code</button>
<div class="content">
<pre><code>
-- Temporary Table to only show relevant characters in future queries
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_characters AS
	SELECT *
		FROM 
			characters
		WHERE
			AccessLevel = 0 AND level > 10;
	
-- Count records to verify results
SELECT
	COUNT(*)
FROM
	temp_characters
</code></pre>
</div>
				<br><br><br>
				<h4>Gameplay Experience Improvement</h4>
				Now we can look at a breakdown of class distribution throughout the characters. 
				The numerical values in 'Class' are used to determine the type. 
				A CASE expression can be used to create these categories.<br>
				<br>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">View Code</button>
<div class="content">
<pre><code>
-- What class do most players use?
-- Building query to determine class from numerical data
SELECT 
	char_name,
	CASE
		WHEN Class = 0 OR Class = 1 THEN 'Monarch'
		WHEN Class = 61 OR Class = 48 THEN 'Knight'
		WHEN Class = 734 OR Class = 1186 THEN 'Wizard'
		WHEN Class = 138 OR Class = 37 THEN 'Elf'
		WHEN Class = 2786 OR Class = 2796 THEN 'Dark Elf'
		ELSE 'Invalid Class'
	END AS 
		characterClass
FROM 
	temp_characters
ORDER BY
	characterClass
</code></pre>
</div>
				<br><br>
				Result: No Invalid Classes<br>
				<br>
				This shows all characters and corresponding classes. 
				Validation of the process throughout is important to ensure the results are accurate. 
				Now to determine how many of each class are in use.
				<br>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">View Code</button>
<div class="content">
<pre><code>
-- Count the characters in each class
-- Using the previous CASE expression as a sub-query
SELECT
	characterClass,

		CASE
			WHEN Class = 0 OR Class = 1 THEN 'Monarch'
			WHEN Class = 61 OR Class = 48 THEN 'Knight'
			WHEN Class = 734 OR Class = 1186 THEN 'Wizard'
			WHEN Class = 138 OR Class = 37 THEN 'Elf'
			WHEN Class = 2786 OR Class = 2796 THEN 'Dark Elf'
			ELSE 'Invalid Class'
		END AS 
			characterClass
	FROM 
		temp_characters
	) AS classes  -- this alias is not used, but defining one is required
GROUP BY
	characterClass
ORDER BY
	characterClass
</code></pre>
</div>
				<br><br>
				Result: Dark Elf - 29, Elf - 72, Knight - 69,<br> 
				Monarch - 21, Wizard - 62; Total: 253<br>
				<br>
				Checking this data as a percentage of the total:
				<br>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">View Code</button>
<div class="content">
<pre><code>
-- What percentage of characters exist in each class?
-- Add percentage column: dividing count by total characters
SELECT

FROM(
	SELECT 
		CASE
			WHEN Class = 0 OR Class = 1 THEN 'Monarch'
			WHEN Class = 61 OR Class = 48 THEN 'Knight'
			WHEN Class = 734 OR Class = 1186 THEN 'Wizard'
			WHEN Class = 138 OR Class = 37 THEN 'Elf'
			WHEN Class = 2786 OR Class = 2796 THEN 'Dark Elf'
			ELSE 'Invalid Class'
		END AS 
			characterClass
	FROM 
		temp_characters
	) AS classes  -- this alias is not used, but defining one is required
GROUP BY
	characterClass
ORDER BY
	characterClass
</code></pre>
</div>
				<br><br>
				Result: Dark Elf - 11.46%, Elf - 28.46%, Knight - 27.27%,<br>
				Monarch - 8.30%, Wizard - 24.51%; Total: 100%
				<br><br>
				More balance is necessary to make Monarch and Dark Elf viable.
				<br><br>
				Checking which stats characters use most:
				<br>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">View Code</button>
<div class="content">
<pre><code>
-- What stats do each class use?
-- Average of each stat for each class
SELECT

	END AS 
		characterClass,
	-- Average of each stat
	AVG(Str), AVG(Con), AVG(Dex),
	AVG(Cha), AVG(Intel), AVG(Wis)
FROM
	temp_characters
GROUP BY
	characterClass
ORDER BY
	characterClass
</code></pre>
</div>
				<br><br>
				Each class has 1-2 stats that can have bonuses applied to make them a more effective choice.
				<br><br>
				Checking which weapons characters use most:
				<br>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">View Code</button>
<div class="content">
<pre><code>
-- What weapon do characters use?
-- Get item name from character_items table
SELECT
	item_name,
	COUNT(*) as total
FROM
	character_items
WHERE
	-- Verify the item is being used (equipped)
	is_equipped = 1 AND
	
	-- Verify the item is a weapon***
	item_id IN(
		SELECT 
			item_id 
		FROM 
			weapon
	) AND
	
	-- Verify character is from temp_characters***
	char_id IN(
			SELECT 
				objid
			FROM
				temp_characters
	)
		
GROUP BY
	item_name
ORDER BY
	total DESC
</code></pre>
</div>
				<br><br>
				While this is a singular snapshot - a large number of players have beginner items. 
				Incentive to upgrade can be accomplished by reducing usefulness of beginner items or raising effectiveness of obtainable alternatives.
				<br><br>
				*** JOIN statments can be used to verify the character being a part of the temp_characters subset and that the item in question is a weapon.
				This increases the efficiency of the query.
				<br>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">View Code</button>
<div class="content">
<pre><code>
-- What weapon do characters use?
-- Utilizing JOINs this time
-- Get item name from character_items table
SELECT
	item_name,
	COUNT(*) as total
FROM 
	character_items
JOIN 
	-- Foreign Key of items table linked to character
	temp_characters ON 
	character_items.char_id = temp_characters.objid
JOIN
	-- Foreign Key of weapon table linked to character_items
	weapon ON
	character_items.item_id = weapon.item_id
WHERE
	-- Verify the item is being used (equipped)
	is_equipped = 1
GROUP BY
	item_name
ORDER BY
	total DESC
</code></pre>
</div>
				<br><br>
				Now that we've looked at what weapons characters are using, 
				we can check which weapons players enchant (improve) most often.
				Which weapons are worthwhile?
				<br>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">View Code</button>
<div class="content">
<pre><code>
-- What enchant level of weapon do players have?
-- What weapons do players find are worth enchanting (improving) and to what degree?

-- List Items by Class and Enchant Level
SELECT 
	temp_characters.char_name,
		-- Differentiate characters by class
	CASE
		WHEN Class = 0 OR Class = 1 THEN 'Monarch'
		WHEN Class = 61 OR Class = 48 THEN 'Knight'
		WHEN Class = 734 OR Class = 1186 THEN 'Wizard'
		WHEN Class = 138 OR Class = 37 THEN 'Elf'
		WHEN Class = 2786 OR Class = 2796 THEN 'Dark Elf'
		ELSE 'Invalid Class'
	END AS 
		characterClass,
	character_items.item_name,
	character_items.enchantlvl
FROM 
	character_items
JOIN 
	-- Foreign Key of items table linked to character
	temp_characters ON 
	character_items.char_id = temp_characters.objid
WHERE 
	-- Verify the item is a weapon
	item_id IN(
		SELECT 
			item_id 
		FROM 
			weapon
	)
ORDER BY 
	characterClass,
	character_items.enchantlvl DESC
</code></pre>
</div>
				<br><br>
				A large amount of Wizard class characters use the same weapon and enchant them often.<br>
				This means more variety of useful weapons is necessary for this class.
				<br><br>
				<h4>Routine Checks</h4>
				Non-Player Characters (NPCs) are any characters in a game that are not controlled by a player. 
				These may be friendly (shop keepers) or hostile (monsters). 
				Over time, new NPCs are added by administrators. 
				Verification of proper data loading ensures smooth operation of the game.
				<br><br>
				Monsters and Bosses added have requirements in multiple tables.<br>
				This check verfies the correct information exists for bosses.
				<br>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">View Code</button>
<div class="content">
<pre><code>
-- Do all bosses in the spawnlist exist in the monster list?
SELECT DISTINCT 
	npc_id 
FROM 
	spawnlist_boss 
WHERE 
	npc_id 
NOT IN (
	SELECT 
		npc.npcid 
	FROM 
		npc
	)
</code></pre>
</div>
				<br><br>
				Inexperienced admins tend to add bosses without filling data in everywhere it is required or enter invalid data.
				<br><br>
				Shops are utilized to buy and sell items. Like the monster data, shops require proper structure to be added correctly. 
				This check verfies that shop data contains valid item data.
				<br>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">View Code</button>
<div class="content">
<pre><code>
-- Are items sold in shops valid, existing items?
SELECT * 
FROM 
	shop
LEFT JOIN 
	-- Compare to etcitem table
	etcitem ON 
	shop.item_id = etcitem.item_id 
LEFT JOIN 
	-- Compare to armor table
	armor ON 
	shop.item_id = armor.item_id
LEFT JOIN 
	-- Compare to weapon table
	weapon ON 
	shop.item_id = weapon.item_id
WHERE 
	-- If NULL in all 3 places, 
	-- an invalid item is being sold in shops
	etcitem.item_id IS NULL AND
	armor.item_id IS NULL AND
	weapon.item_id IS NULL
</code></pre>
</div>
				<br><br>
				Again, inexperienced admins tend to add items to shops without filling data in everywhere it is needed or enter invalid data.
				<br><br>
				Lastly, it is important to keep an eye on currency data.<br>
				Balancing the game's economy requires proper distribution and accumulation rates of wealth.
				<br><br>
				This check displays the current wealth in currency of each player.
				<br>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">View Code</button>
<div class="content">
<pre><code>
-- How much money do characters have?
SELECT
	temp_characters.char_name,
	character_items.count AS currency
FROM
	temp_characters
INNER JOIN
	character_items ON
	temp_characters.objid = character_items.char_id
WHERE
	item_id = 40308 -- item_id for currency 
ORDER BY
	count DESC
</code></pre>
</div>
				<br><br>
				8 players have more than $10M.<br>
				What can be introduced worth spending on? No extreme outliers exist, but it is important to 
				investigate the top earners to ensure no unfair advantages exist.
				<br><br>
				<h4>Processing Results</h4>
				I extracted the temp_characters table to a CSV file and loaded it into Tableau to generate visualizations.
				<br><br>
				<img src="images/mmorpg-summary.png" width="850" height="590">
				<br><br>
				<h4>Insights</h4>
				Monarch and Dark Elf classes require improvement to balance out class utilization.<br>
				Determine the underlying reasons why these are used less often.
				<br><br>
				Charisma is the most underutilized stat across most classes.<br>
				Adding bonuses for this stat allows for more viable character choices.
				<br><br>
				Wizards have the least variance in chosen stats.<br>
				Weapon options and pet balances can bring them more in line with other classes.
