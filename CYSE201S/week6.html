						<p>
							Can you spot three fake websites and compare the three fake websites to three real websites, plus showcase what makes the fake websites fake?

				<h2>#1: Taylor Swift Merchandise</h2>
				<h3>Fake: https:// taylorswiftmerch .us</h3>
				<h3>Fake: https:// theerastourmerch.store</h3>
				<h3>Real: https:// store.taylorswift .com</h3>
				<p>
					I often run into this issue with family members asking me for gift ideas for my wife.
					They know she is a Taylor Swift fan and want to get her something she doesn't have.
					There is only 1 official website for merchandise.
					I'm fairly certain it hasn't changed in over 13 years.
					Different websites have been brought to me over the years.
					The allure of unique or discounted goods is too much for some though.
					The websites pop up from time to time and don't last very long.
					I was able to capture one to document for this journal entry.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is a mixture of items for sale on these websites.
					Some merchandise is identical to the official store, but all of the prices are extraordinarily high.
					Other things like a $200 poster on sale for $100 and a $500 pack of 900 wallpapers on sale for $200 are red flags.
					The wallpaper pack is listed as "900+] Taylor Swift Wallpapers" (typos) and is available in sizes, small through extra-extra-extra large.
					Displays of "Free shipping on orders over $300" and "$600" are alarming.
					The Contact and About pages are significantly lacking in content.
					The social media link buttons point back to the contact website instead of to actual social media pages.
					Both fake websites use https, which gives them the appearance of some credibility.
					I think this is actually because they do process transactions and ship products, just over priced knock offs.
				</p>
				<h2>#2: Seed Gamer</h2>
				<h3>Fake: https:// seedgamer .com</h3>
				<h3>Real: https:// www.smartseedsemporium .com</h3>
				<p>
					This website was brought to my attention recently by family members as well.
					The text message read along the lines of "look at these amazing flowers, I bought seeds".
					If you happen to take a look, search for ragdoll cat, my favorite.
				</p>
				<p>
					One way to tell this is fake would be the multitude of AI generated flower images.
					Some look like cat faces growing on stems.
					The plant names are mostly real, but the real plants look nothing like the images.
					Another way would be to research the website.
					There are websites that provide domain information and give a trustworthiness rating.
					Most scam websites were recently created.
					This website has a safety score of 0 out of 100 and is a month old.
					The About and Contact pages are sketchy as expected.
				</p>
				<p>
					Smart Seeds Emporium has a safety score of 95 out of 100.
					The domain was created in 2018.
					The only strike against it listed is that it has few visitors.
					The contact page has addresses and phone numbers.
				</p>
				<h2>#3: Tiffany & Co.</h2>
				<h3>Fake: https:// tiffanycoshop .com/</h3>
				<h3>Real: https:// www.tiffany .com/</h3>
				<p>
					I bought a necklace for my wife from Tiffany & Co for Christmas.
					They send promotional emails from time to time.
					Links to their website are included in the emails and I am familiar with the website.
				</p>
				<p>
					The social media links point to the website of the social media company.
					For example, the Facebook icon points to facebook .com instead of a link to their facebook page.
					Products have no reviews.
					The like buttons on product pages link to Facebook's website.
					The follow links on product pages lead to the US Postal Service page on Facebook.
					The share links attempt to share the USPS page on Facebook.
					Louis Vuitton dust bag and box included with purchases.
					Mostly all of the products for sale are listed between $30 and $50.
					A bangle from Tiffany's website listed at $32,250 is on the fake site for $47.50.
