				<h3>#1: Multiple Reasons</h3>
				<p>
					People do what they do for many different reasons.
					Most of the time, there are multiple reasons for what they do.
					There is no exception for cybercrime.
					Earning money in a way that is entertaining seems like a reasonable motive for mischief.
				</p>
				<h3>#2: For Money</h3>
				<p>
					Outside of living on a farm, basic needs are met with money.
					Cybercriminals who have found a way to turn their talents into profit would struggle to not take the easy route.
					This does not mean that the task at hand is easy, but that the earning potential can be disproportionately in favor of criminal activity due to the fact that it is not necessarily paid by the hour.
				</p>
				<h3>#3: Political</h3>
				<p>
					Activism is a practice that can often lead to morally bending the rules, if not outright breaking them, for the greater good.
					I can understand that there are times when this is necessary, especially when the opposition has vast resources.
					It makes sense to me when the goal is to expose concealed truths that cause harm to others.
				</p>
				<h3>#4: Entertainment</h3>
				<p>
					I enjoy a good challenge. Preferably, the fun does not come at the expense of others.
					There are plenty of careers and creative outlets to exercise computer skills.
					Cyberbullying comes into play here as well. There is no justification for it, but in terms of why - I can’t think of a better reason..
				</p>
				<h3>#5: Boredom</h3>
				<p>
					The desire for meaningful tasks is a key element of the human experience.
					If criminal activity is what brings a person satisfaction, prison is the only thing at the end of that rainbow.
					While I can’t understand it, there are other motives that are even less reasonable.
				</p>
				<h3>#6: Recognition</h3>
				<p>
					I often wonder in what ways the world would be a better place if talented people used their abilities for a more worthy purpose than circumventing the rules.
					Fame is absolutely useless in my opinion.
					To desire being recognized for wrongdoing is beneath fame.
				</p>
				<h3>#7: Revenge</h3>
				<p>
					There is no useful purpose for cybercrime as revenge. 
					Social media culture is largely to blame for the effectiveness and pervasiveness of this tragic trend. 
					Revenge as a motive will never make sense to me.
				</p>
