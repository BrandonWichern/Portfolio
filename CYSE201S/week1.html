					Clearly I am in favor of software development, as I am pursuing a computer science major. 
					Solving problems through the creation of innovative tools using computers captured my interest in high school. 
					Since then, my experiences in the Navy and my current professional role have developed an appreciation for high-quality 
					instructional materials and the tools used to create them. 
					Cyber instructor and curriculum development are aligned with those passions.
					<br><br>
					All-source analysis offers an avenue for working with data and drawing insightful conclusions. Analysis, as a whole, has 
					consistently been my comfort zone. Cyber Defense Analysis is appealing in the digital detective aspect, but incident response 
					is a path I am not likely to pursue. Similarly, Test and Evaluation is an area that fails to capture my interest. 
					I find myself more drawn to penetration testing due to the challenges presented vice the structured testing phases during system setup.
