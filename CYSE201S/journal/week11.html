					The cybersecurity analyst role involves protecting systems and networks from cyberattacks through various methods of intervention and prevention.
					Providing guidance and training for a company's workforce involves understanding how access to technology and experience with usage differs amongst different groups of people.
					Building a community that encourages honest communication about efficient identification and resolution of incidents results in more effective network monitoring.
					Research skills and networking with others would be necessary to determine where best to earn a reasonable living wage compared with the cost of living at different job locations.
					Meeting people and volunteering throughout the processes of education and gaining employment is valuable in building experience.
