				<p>
					Movies and television shows portray cybersecurity as mysterious and futuristic. 
					Cyber criminals approach every situation with a software or hardware tool that would have to be created for a specific scenario. 
					Similarly comical is the “enhance button” trope - when a detective zooms in on an image or video and improves the quality beyond its original format. 
					The fictional exaggeration of technological capabilities is good for ratings, but ultimately viewers who believe the disinformation are pushed further into the fear of the unknown. 
					Realistically, no one wants to watch extensive periods of searching for security flaws to exploit. Hacking is more tricking people to give up information that can be used against them. 
					I hope no one looks to entertainment media for educational purposes, so I would consider this portrayal mostly harmless.
