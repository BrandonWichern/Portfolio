					<h3>Prompt</h3>

						<p>

				<p>
					The route taken to the speaker's digital forensics investigator career is interesting and educational. 
					I would not expect a person starting out as an accountant to end up in a field like that. 
					I can see how the knowledge and skills could be useful, but I do not think it is a common crossover. 
					He was presented with and open to great opportunities at the right times. 
					His job description involving information technology responsibilities also allowed him to develop and grow the necessary interests and abilities. 
					Fields relating to cybercrime were less defined and advertised then compared to today. 
					The progression would have to be less direct as technology and the surrounding needs evolved along with the absence of formal training programs.
