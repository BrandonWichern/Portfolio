				<p>
					This article provided an extensive and comprehensive overview of a topic I had not previously explored. 
					In recent years, there have been stories from political news sources detailing how each party attributes their opponent's success to foreign interference. 
					However, I had not fully grasped the extent of influence operations and information warfare conducted through social media platforms. 
					The article convincingly demonstrates how disinformation can be weaponized and strategically spread through automated means. 
					It outlines the importance of the delicate balance between upholding the principles of free speech and mitigating the dissemination of intentionally false and harmful information. 
					The argument used to be that 24 hour news channels were hazardous, but now each person has an endless, portable, and personalized stream of potential manipulation.
