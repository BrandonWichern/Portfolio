				<h3>Physiological Needs</h3>
					<p>
					Biologically, I can function without technology.
					I grew up in a time where dependency on such things was less pervasive.
					I am a long time fan of air conditioning though. Adjusting the thermostat digitally is a huge convenience as well.
					Temperature control does allow me to sleep well at night. My cell phone's alarm clock will automatically adjust to daylight savings time and wake me in the morning.
					The two tiny living alarm clocks that live with me would certainly gurantee an end to the sleeping time, just not on the kind of schedule required by employment.
					Our air is cleaned by purifiers and a wide variety of food is kept available thanks to refridgeration.
					I was able to find my current home and will find my next home by utilizing web sites and contact information found on the internet.
					</p>
				<h3>Safety Needs</h3>
					<p>
					Currently, I perform the majority of my employer's taskings from home, and I also complete all of my college coursework remotely.
					I found both of the involved organizations online as well.
					I have cameras and digital assistants set up throughout my property to allow for easy viewing and communication with those within my spaces.
					Predictability and control are virtually covered from every angle - literally.
					I used to have an electronic lock as well, but something about batteries being an obstacle didn't sit right with me.
					</p>
				<h3>Love and Belongingness Needs</h3>
					<p>
					Social media gets too much credit for the perception that people feel connected with their loved ones online.
					There is a more instantaneous and continuous connection available thanks to the internet though.
					Making new friends in relation to common interest has been easy for me.
					Being connected to different commuinities and linking to other related subjects also builds connectedness.
					I enjoy getting to digitally share opinions about movies, music, and video games as well as being introduced to more of them all.
					</p>
				<h3>Esteem  Needs</h3>
					<p>
					I have worked with various groups on programming projects as a hobby.
					These collaborations with individuals I only knew online gave me a deep sense of accomplishment.
					I could teach them and build confidence or learn from them and develop mastery of new skills.
					The respect and trust built within a group is not exclusive to a digital experience, but I valued it differently because there were no monetary involements.
					The only incentive was the collective gain of the groups' knowledge and abilities.
					</p>
				<h3>Self-Actualization Needs</h3>
					<p>
					The experiences of being a part of a group engaging in creative activities helped build my desire to seek employment that would be enjoyable and not feel like work.
					I currently have a role and am learning more about ways to improve and prove my abilities in the workforce that would allow me to be my most productive self.
					This would also support all other levels of needs being met simultaneously.<br>
					This feeling is what finding your purpose is all about.
					</p>
