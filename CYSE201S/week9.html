				<p>
					I scored a 0 out of 9 on the Social Media Disorder Scale.
					I very rarely use any social media.
					<br><br>

					If a person honestly answered the questions and received a high score, I can see how that would indicate a problem.
					The list is thorough and well rounded enough to identify issues.
					Certain questions are signs of more concerning conditions than spending time online.
					<br><br>

					Different regions and different countries have a range of variables such as religion, culture, and economic status.
					<br><br>

					How much time does the average person spend online there?<br>
					The more people owning cell phones or computers, the greater the risk.
					<br><br>

					What restrictions, if any, are there to how or when the internet is used?<br>
					Some countries limit online activities through age or time restrictions.
					<br><br>

					Are there any public health campaigns discussing the dangers and promoting appropriate usage?<br>
					The right kind of information presented correctly can bring awareness to and aid in curbing the negative outcomes.
