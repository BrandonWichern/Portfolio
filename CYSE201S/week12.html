					<h3>Prompt</h3>
					<left>
						<p>
							Read the sample breach letter “SAMPLE DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION” and describe how two different
							economics theories and two different social sciences theories relate to the letter.
						</p>
					</left>
				</header>
				<hr>
				<h2>Economics Theories</h2>
				<h3>Theory of Rational Expectations</h3>
				<p>
					Customers have to make decisions based on their expectations.<br>
					They would expect their personal information would be protected from unauthorized access.<br>
					The decisions they make influence the economic outcome for the breached company.<br>
				</p>
				<h3>Monetary Theory</h3>
				<p>
					This breach has a negative impact on the economy.<br>
					Losses incurred by the platform provider, customers, and company result in a reduction in the money supply.<br>
					All parties involved also have to decide how and where to spend more money to aid in recovery.<br>
				</p>

				<h2>Social Sciences Theories</h2>
				<h3>Conflict Theory</h3>
				<p>
					Criminals broke into the company's servers and utilized malware to steal credit card information.<br>
					This attack is a conflict between intruders and customers to obtain payment data for financial resources.<br>
					The situation represents a competition between groups over limited resources.<br>
				</p>
				<h3>Social Capital Theory</h3>
				<p>
					Social Capital Theory emphasizes the importance of trust.<br>
					Relationships between company and customer are delicate - negative circumstances can destroy the social capital.<br>
					The purpose of the notice of breach is to provide transparency in the details and establish trust.<br>
