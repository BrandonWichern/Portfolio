				<p>
					Cyberbullying has been a growing problem in recent years as the online community and number of connected devices has grown. 
					The offenses run a wide range in severity, but with nearly 50% of teens reporting having these harmful experiences, regulations cannot do enough to correct the issue. 
					Gathering information about children is a big deal as they are more vulnerable to having identifiable information used against them and less able to comprehend the possibility of that occurring. 
					The argument could be made that 13 is still too young to not need parental consent. 
					Fraud is a very serious crime with damaging consequences. 
					Online anonymity allows for easily bypassing security checks with the right list of personal information. 
					Torrent services and illegal streaming services both negatively impact the economy. 
					Less products and art are created due to the reality that investors face regarding stolen digital goods impacting profits.
