							A later module addresses cybersecurity policy through a social science framework. 
							At this point, attention can be drawn to one type of policy, known as bug bounty policies. 
							These policies pay individuals for identifying vulnerabilities in a companyâ€™s cyber infrastructure. 
							To identify the vulnerabilities, ethical hackers are invited to try explore the cyber infrastructure using their penetration testing skills.  
							The policies relate to economics in that they are based on cost/benefits principles.  
							Read the provided article and write a summary reaction to the use of the policies in your journal. 
							Focus primarily on the literature review and the discussion of the findings.

					Bug bounty programs are an excellent way for companies to pay for verifiable results to improve security. 
					This is especially helpful due to the cybersecurity workforce shortage. 
					I was surprised that price was not the primary factor for quantity or quality of reports. 
					The fact that size and popularity do not exclude a company from benefiting makes the concept even more universally useful.
					More data is necessary to determine why certain industries get less attention. 
					I am not certain the only reasons are related to the value of the leaked information exceeding the bounty.
					This would imply that even those employed to help companies are also stealing from them.
